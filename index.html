									<h2>Nam Dang</h2>
									<p>Hi, welcome to my porfolio! <br />
										About me, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Business Analytics at Drexel University, with a concentration in Statistics. I have worked for 3+ years in finance and varied from fields such as Risk Management, Financial Service, and Digitalization. 
										Currently my goal is to transition into a Data Analyst or Business Analyst. I enjoy learning about data science - especially how ML algorithms apply to different industries and businesses. I also enjoy doing data exploration and story telling.</p>

										<h2>Project 1<br />
										Loan Predication</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images\loan.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>
									<p>An assurance company is having a critical issue with loan approval process as the current process requires a lot of time and labor resources. The company seeks to automate (in real time) the loan qualifying procedure based on information given by borrowers. A machine learning model can help accelerate decision-making process with higher accuracy in approving a loan for a new borrower.</p>
									<p>Skills: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-NN.	</p>

										<h2>Project 2<br />
										Fantasy Football</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images\PL.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>
									<p>Fantasy league is a popular online game for sports fans to participate in. The game allows players to act as team managers and choose different soccer players to form a team. The objective of this project is to develop a linear programming model that can predict the most optimal fantasy team for each week of the Premier League, the world's most popular football league. We will be using data from the league to inform our decision-making process. </p>
									<p>Skills: Linear Programming, Optimization, Branch and Bound.</p>

										<h2>Project 3<br />
										Amazon's Tiny Profit</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images\Amazon.png" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>
									<p>Amazon has always had a large discrepancy between its revenue and profits (Net Income). This is because Amazon invests a large chunk of their revenue on capital expenses such as Data centers, warehouses, upgrading distribution centers. To be able to forecast with reasonable accuracy the revenue and net income for the upcoming quarter would enable amazon to plan in a better way their expenses and help them make better business decisions. I have used 2 different iterations of 2 forecasting methods (ETS and ARIMA) to make the forecasts for Revenue forecasting as well as Net Income forecasting.</p>
									<p>Skills: Time Series forcasting, ETS, ARIMA, fpp3 package.</p>

										<h2>Project 4<br />
										Stock Price Prediction</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images\stock.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300"/></a>
									<p>Forecasting Stock Price is always a challenge, as stock movement has a lot of white noice and unpredictable pattern. However, it's always tempting to research on Stock Prediction, as you can potentially make some money on the market if your model does well. In this project, I attempted to forecast the price of FPT, a blue chip stock in VNINDEX, using Random Forest and TSLM.</p>

										<h2>Project 5<br />
										OCR for Bond Document</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images\ocr.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300"/></a>
									<p>Lengthy financial documents have always posed a challenge for investors to read and identify key metrics, mainly because it takes time and labor intensive. Is there a tool that can automate the process of skimming through ~500 pages of a financial document, and output only the key metrics? In this project, I attempted to create a OCR tool to help with reading the document by using DOCX, a open-source library on Python.</p>
									<p>Skills: OCR, NLP, PDF reader.</p>

										<h2>Project 6<br />
										Employee Retention Analysis</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images\employee.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300"/></a>
									<p>This project aims to elaborate the problem of employee attrition, present the findings of research conducted on factors influencing it, and offer potential solutions to curb attrition. It also provides a deeper insight into the process I followed while conducting the analyses. I did this using supervised & unsupervised methods of building prediction models in R</p>
									<p>Skills: Classification models, Decision tree, SVM, Cluster analysis.</p>

										<h2>Project 7<br />
										A/B Testing for CCG Advertisement</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images\event.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I conducted a simple A/B testing on the event advertisement emails for CCG. I sent out 2 emails: one uses formal and professional language, and the other contains a more student-like, laid back content. I wanted to know if student's sign-up rate and attendance rate differ between the two email group. Therefore, I used A/B testing, complementary with Bayesian Analysis to intepret the result.</p>
									<p>Skills: A/B Testing, Bayesian Analysis, Marketing.</p>
